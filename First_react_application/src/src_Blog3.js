    <p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs,
       each of which is coextensive with a respective county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn (Kings County),
        Queens (Queens County), Manhattan (New York County), the Bronx (Bronx County), and Staten Island (Richmond County)—were created
         when local governments were consolidated into a single municipal entity in 1898.[15] The city and its metropolitan area constitute
          the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[16] making it the
           most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,
            the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[17][18] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated
             to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have
              the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[19]
              New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in approximately 1624.
               The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under English control
                in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[20][21] The city was regained
                 by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674.
                  New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[22] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted
                   millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty
                    and peace.[23] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[24] and environmental sustainability,
                     and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people
                      from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.

Many districts and monuments in New York City are major landmarks, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013.[29] A record 66.6 million tourists visited New York City in 2019. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[30] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[29][31] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[32] Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world, as is the city's fast pace,[33][34][35] spawning the term New York minute.[36] The Empire State Building has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures.[37][38][39] Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[40][41] Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City That Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York system, which is the largest urban public university system in the United States. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial center and the most financially powerful city in the world, and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.</p>
